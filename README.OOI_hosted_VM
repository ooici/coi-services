The OOI hosted VM image comes with a demo account pre-installed with 
coi-services and ion-ux under the account ooici.

This should serve as a reference install to verify the VM is working as expected.

To setup our environment on this VM (assuming using your own account) follow the
following steps.

1. Setup a github account:
	https://confluence.oceanobservatories.org/display/CIDev/Github+Account+Setup

2. Clone the repository:
	git clone git@github.com:ooici/coi-services.git

3. Go into the coi-services directory:
	cd coi-services/

4. Download the submodules needed by the system:
	git submodule update --init

5. Create a virtual environment to work in:
	mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages coi

   Virtualenv for python allows a user to install packages without installing 
   them to privileged system directories. The benefit of this is that an 
   environment can be easily discarded and rebuilt without tainting the base 
   system.

   The 2 key commands to know when working with virtualenv's is

	mkvirtualenv -- creates a new virtual environment

	workon -- loads in an existing virtual environment.

6. Install 2 packages needed inside the virtual environment:
	pip install -U setuptools==0.8
	pip install numpy==1.7.1

7. Inform the system about postgres account details by defining them in a
   config file.
	vi res/config/pyon.local.yml

   For the ooi created VM's this file should look like:
	system:
	  name: uidev
	server:
	  postgresql:
	    username: ion
	    password: ion
	    admin_username: ion
	    admin_password: ion

   Alternatively, it can be coppied from the ooici home directory to your
   res/config directory by doing:
	cp ~ooici/pyon.local.yml res/config/

8. Build the system:
	python bootstrap.py -v 2.2.0
	bin/buildout
	bin/generate_interfaces

9. Check that you have a good install:
	bin/nosetests -a SMOKE

   If none of these tests fail/error, then it is safe to assume you have 
   a working install.

10. OOI guidelines on using GIT:
	Prior to following this guide, it is assumed you have already
	performed:
		git remote rename origin ooici

If you are running the OOI system in a custom environment or on a mac, 
it is required that postgres be correctly configured.

as user postgres:
	echo "drop user ion;" | psql
	createuser -s ion
	echo "create database ion;" | psql
	echo "grant all on database ion to ion;" | psql
	echo "alter user ion with password 'ion';" | psql

This will create a superuser postgress account called ion with password ion.
It is strongly reccomended you change the password to something much better.

You can test that you have postgres correctly configured by returning to your 
own user account and running:
	psql -U ion -h localhost -p 5432

	<enter the password you used above>

You should see something similar to:
	psql (9.3.2)
	Type "help" for help.
	
	ion=>

In order to configure coi-services to know the database connection details,
create a file in coi-services/res/config/pyon.local.yml containing:
        system:
          name: uidev
        server:
          postgresql:
            username: ion
            password: ion
            admin_username: ion
            admin_password: ion

Running Transform Examples in Pyon

Currently there are (4) examples that can be run. 

   * basic_transform
        Runs a basic example of a transform. It chains two transforms together, each add 1 to their input

        Producer -> A -> B
        Producer generates a number every four seconds and publishes it on the 'ctd_output_stream'
          the producer is acting as a CTD or instrument in this example.
        A is a basic transform that increments its input and publishes it on the 'transform_output' stream.
        B is a basic transform that receives input.
        All transforms write logging data to '/tmp/transform_output' so you can visually see activity of the transforms
   
   * reverse_transform
       Runs a reverse transform example and displays the results of performing the transform

   * even_odd_transform
       This example script runs a chained three way transform:
            B
        A <
            C
        Where A is the even_odd transform (generates a stream of even and odd numbers from input)
        and B and C are the basic transforms that receive even and odd input

   * external_transform
        This example script illustrates how a transform can interact with the an outside process (very basic)
        it launches an external_transform example which uses the operating system command 'bc' to add 1 to the input

        Producer -> A -> '/tmp/transform_output'
        A is an external transform that spawns an OS process to increment the input by 1

From REL file:
   To run the examples from the REL file:
      specify the desired example in res/deploy/examples/trasnform_example.yml on line 42 to one of the above example names.

Run the scripts interactively:

   Each file in the gist corresponds to a different scenario from the view of the client. You can copy the entire file and paste it into pycc (with %paste) or you can go line by line.

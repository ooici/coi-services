- Initial definitions and preliminary tests.
  The plan is to use the actual CGSN Services endpoint for testing but I'm
  including a very rudimentary simulator for basic tests.

  Running the local simulator:
    $ bin/python ion/agents/platform/cgsn/simulator/cgsn_simulator_server.py
    CgsnSimulatorServer listening on localhost:2221 ...
    started thread.
    Listening on localhost:2221
    Enter ^D to exit

  Tests:
    $ bin/nosetests -sv ion/agents/platform/cgsn/test/test_cgsn_client.py
